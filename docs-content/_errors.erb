As part of the toolset to ensure that the Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF
services are highly available, a number of internal checks and processes
run frequently to ensure the health of the system.

It's possible that some of these checks fail due to actions performed against
the service.

The PostgreSQL Healthcheck ensures the following:
- Role is expected value: primary/replica
- PostgreSQL is ready
- Recovery Status, if failover occurs
- Replication Status
- Filesystem usage

If any of the above tests return an unexpected value, the BOSH job is alerted of this condition,
allowing Platform Administrators to quickly and easily identify troubled service instances.
