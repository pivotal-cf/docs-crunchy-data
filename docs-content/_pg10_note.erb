<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF cannot be directly upgraded from v4 with PostgreSQL v9.5 to v5 with PostgreSQL v10.  </br> Instead, perform a migration upgrade, rather than an in-place upgrade. For more information regarding migrations, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/crunchy/migration.html">Migration</a>.  </br> If continued support is needed for PostgreSQL v9.5, contact <a href="mailto:crunchypcf@crunchydata.com">Crunchy Data for PCF</a>. For additional consulting assistance to plan a data migration effort, contact us at info@crunchydata.com.</p>
