#### Using Cloud Foundry CLI

To unbind your app from your service, run `cf unbind-service APP_NAME
SERVICE_INSTANCE`, substituting `APP_NAME` with the name of your PCF app and
`SERVICE_INSTANCE` with the name of your service. For example:

```
cf unbind-service myApp <%= service_instance_name %>
```
