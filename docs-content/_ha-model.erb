Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF provisions a cluster of PostgreSQL servers and self-configures their roles (primary and many replicas).
This allows the servers to change their roles when failures are detected.

Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF configuration files are managed by `consul-template`.
Each of these templates watch different parts of the stack.
When changes are detected, configuration files automatically are rendered with the latest state.
This allows the system to be dynamic and change depending on state of services.

For example, the PostgreSQL load balancer automatically detects when replicas are added or removed,
and reconfigures its pool to reflect the current state.
