##<a id='cc'></a> Common Criteria Certification

Certified Crunchy PostgreSQL is the first open source relational database to be certified at Common Criteria EAL 2+.

[Press Release](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1685/).

##<a id='stig'></a> DISA Security Technical Implementation

Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration standards for United States Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance (IA) and IA-enabled devices/systems published by the United States Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).
Since 1998, DISA has played a critical role enhancing the security posture of DoD's security systems by providing the STIGs.
The STIGs contain technical guidance to “lock down” information systems/software that might otherwise be vulnerable to a malicious computer attack.

Importantly, compliance with the STIG guidance requires only open source software and documentation.
The PostgreSQL STIG is based on open source, unmodified PostgreSQL 9.x used in conjunction with certain open source PostgreSQL extensions – most notably, pgaudit.

<p class='note'>Out of the box, Crunchy PostgreSQL service instances are configured to be 100% STIG Compliant.</p>

###<a id='intro'></a> DISA PostgreSQL STIG Automation

Developed to reduce the time it takes to secure authority to operate certification for cloud services, the technology leverages open source software to provide automated compliance testing.
In this case, the compliance testing and subsequent review and approval was accomplished within 72 hours, which is a major reduction in effort compared to previous attempts.
The PostgreSQL STIG Automation project utilizes the [InSpec Project](https://www.inspec.io/), which provides an open source compliance, security and policy testing framework, to dynamically extract system configuration information.
This information is checked against strict security DoD guidelines crafted by industry-leading PostgreSQL security experts.
The PostgreSQL STIG Automation project also electronically supplements the Body of Evidence required to verify NIST 800-53 and the government’s compliance requirements.

###<a id='overview'></a> Automation Process Overview

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/jOe9vQ8.png' />

1. DISA STIG loaded and saved as `*.ckl` file
2. `stig2inspec` tool is used to convert `*.ckl` file into an InSpec tests collection
3. Each STIG test case is transferred into either a Base Profile or Overlay
4. Base Profile and Overlay tests are integrated into a BOSH Job and integrated with a Service Job
5. Once user creates an instance of the Crunchy Service, a STIG compliance job is automatically configured to scan that system
6. Full, basic, and ICS 500-27 Reports are automatically generated and are available for the security team (for each service)
7. Platform Administrator can use `inspec2ckl` to convert this report into a `*.ckl` (STIG Viewer) file for analysis (see below)

###<a id='sitg_vw'></a> Using DISA STIG Viewer

Once a Compliance Report is generated `inspec2ckl` tool is used to convert it into a `*.ckl` (Checklist) format.
At this point System Compliance Assesor can use Stig Viewer to verify results of every automated test.
Results of each test are appended to the Finding Dtails field.

##<a id='ics_500'></a> ICS 500-27 Audit with Crunchy pgAudit

Crunchy’s pgAudit enhances PostgreSQL's logging abilities by allowing administrators to audit specific classes of operations or choosing specific objects to monitor and provides detailed session and/or object audit logging.

<p class='note warning'>
<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong>
Out of the box, Crunchy PostgreSQL service instances are configured to be 100% STIG Compliant for capturing all required Audit statements with proper level of details.
Changing any of these setting will mark the instance as "Not Compliant"
</p>


Session auditing allows administrators to choose classes of statements to log:

```
READ (SELECT and COPY when the source is a relation or a query)
WRITE (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, and COPY when the destination is a relation)
FUNCTION (Functions and DO blocks)
ROLE (GRANT, REVOKE, CREATE/ALTER/DROP ROLE)
DDL (All DDL not included in ROLE)
MISC (DISCARD, FETCH, CHECKPOINT, VACUUM)
```

Example

```

```
AUDIT_TYPE - SESSION or OBJECT.
STATEMENT_ID - Unique statement ID for this session. Each statement ID represents a backend call. Statement IDs are sequential even if some statements are not logged. There may be multiple entries for a statement ID when more than one relation is logged.
SUBSTATEMENT_ID - Sequential ID for each sub-statement within the main statement. For example, calling a function from a query. Sub-statement IDs are continuous even if some sub-statements are not logged. There may be multiple entries for a sub-statement ID when more than one relation is logged.
CLASS - e.g. READ, ROLE (see pgaudit.log).
COMMAND - e.g. ALTER TABLE, SELECT.OBJECT_TYPE - TABLE, INDEX, VIEW, etc. Available for SELECT, DML and most DDL statements.
OBJECT_NAME - The fully-qualified object name (e.g. public.account). Available for SELECT, DML and most DDL statements.
STATEMENT - Statement executed on the backend.
PARAMETER - If pgaudit.log_parameter is set then this field will contain the statement parameters as quoted CSV.
