The following keys are available in the service credentials JSON object:

* **db_host**: IP address for database write commands
* **db_name**: database name
* **db_port**: TCP port for database write commands
* **jdbc\_read\_uri**: JDBC connection URI for database read commands;
`jdbc:postgresql://db_host:db_port/db_name`
* **jdbc_uri**: JDBC connection URI for database write commands;
`jdbc:postgresql://read_host:read_port/db_name`
* **password**: password for database user
* **read_host**: IP address for database read commands
* **read_port**: TCP port for database read commands
* **read_uri**: standard postgresql connection URI for database read commands;
`postgresql://username:password@db_host:db_port/db_name`
* **uri**: standard postgresql connection URI for database write commands;
`postgresql://username:password@read_host:read_port/read_name`

The following keys are available if `monitoring` parameter was set to `true` during
provisioning:

- **prometheus_host**: host of the Prometheus server for monitoring data
- **prometheus_port**: connection port for the Prometheus server
- **prometheus_username**: username for accessing Prometheus
- **prometheus_password**: password for accessing Prometheus

#### Accessing the Primary Database Server

To access the primary database server, which should be used for database write
operations, use the `db_host` and `db_port` keys to construct a connection
string. The `uri` and `jdbc_uri` may also be used to connect to the primary
database server when supported by the client application or library.

#### Accessing the Replica Database Server(s)

To access the replica database server(s), which should be used for database
read operations, use the `read_host` and `read_port` keys to construct a
connection string. The `read_uri` and `jdbc_read_uri` may also be used to
connect to the replica database server(s) when supported by the client
application or library.
