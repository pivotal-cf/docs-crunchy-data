Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Tile is an on-demand, single-tenant PostgreSQL database service.

Crunchy PostgreSQL comes with one service: <%= service_version %>

This service includes:

* PostgreSQL
  * Can be configured as either cluster (primary and replicas) or standalone

The cluster plans also include:

* Load balancer
* pgBackRest dedicated backup
* Consul cluster

Backups performed by pgBackRest are stored within the service instance by default.
These backups can be used in the event of [disaster recovery](disaster-recovery.html), or
to assist when migrating from one service to another.
