The `<%= service_version -%>` service comes with several preconfigured plans.

Each plan corresponds to different server size set up by the operator when the service was deployed.

The following table provides information about the out-of-the-box cluster configurations.
Review each plan offering and choose the correct database plan for the application.

| Plan Name            | Description                                                                            |
| ---------            | -----------                                                                            |
| `standalone`         | Single PostgreSQL server, useful for small development purposes                        |
| `standalone-replica` | Single PostgreSQL server configured as a remote replica for an existing parent service |
| `general`            | Standard service plan, configured to fit most general use cases                        |
| `general-monitor`    | Same as `general`, but with added support for Grafana monitoring                       |
| `custom`             | Uses similar `general` plan settings, configurable to specific use cases               |
| `custom-monitor`     | Same as `custom` but with added support for Grafana monitoring                         |

The current limitations for these cluster configurations are as follows:

- The number of replicas are only configurable during initial setup.
- All replicas use `async` replication. `sync` replication is not yet configurable.
- Standalone instances should be used with care, as they lack any of the integrated backup or recovery systems provided in the General plans.
