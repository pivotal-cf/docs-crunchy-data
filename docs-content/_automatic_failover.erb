Crunchy Cluster Manager runs on each of the Consul Servers within the Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform.
The job of CCM is to detect failures of the PostgreSQL servers and to determine who is the best candidate to replace a failed primary.

Once a new primary role is elected, CCM updates the Consul Service Catalog to reflect the new state.
The newly elected primary reconfigures itself (triggers a failover) and all other services detect the new primary.

Failed former primaries are put into a fenced state.
This tells the rest of the stack to no longer communicate with the failed service.
An hourly `cron` job attempts to repair fenced servers and add them to the replica pool.
