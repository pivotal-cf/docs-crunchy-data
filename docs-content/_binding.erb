#### Using Cloud Foundry CLI

When the status of your service is **create succeeded** you can bind an app to
the service by running `cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE`,
substituting `APP_NAME` with the name of your PCF app and `SERVICE_INSTANCE`
with the name of your service. For example:

```
cf bind-service myApp <%= service_instance_name %>
cf restage myApp
```

<p class="note">
You must restage or restart your app before it will have access to the service
credentials.
</p>

#### Using Pivotal Apps Manager

service.
1. Select the **Overview** tab, then click the **Bind Apps** button.
