Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Tile uses
[pgBackRest](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest) as a dedicated backup
and archiving host. The tile comes pre-configured with nightly physical backups
of the database server for non-standalone plans:

| Day       | Backup Type | Time     |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Sunday    | Full        | 1 am UTC |
| Monday    | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Tuesday   | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Wednesday | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Thursday  | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Friday    | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Saturday  | Incremental | 1 am UTC |

Although backups only happen once a day, PostgreSQL is continuously shipping
the Write-Ahead-Logs (WAL) to the pgBackrest server. This means that
point-in-time recovery is possible, regardless of the schedule.

These backups not only offer peace of mind, but are used frequently by the
tile.

Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF uses backups to create replicas in the stack.
By using backups in operations, we ensure that backup and restore operations are functioning properly.

All archives from the database server are stored on the dedicated backup host.
This means that databases can be restored to specific points in time.

Currently, individual databases cannot be restored. All databases are restored in the shared cluster.

<p class="note warning"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Standalone plans do not include automatic backups.
When using a standalone plan, it is advised to regularly perform manual backups using external tools.
