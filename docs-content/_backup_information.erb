Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform Tile uses
[pgBackRest](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest) as a dedicated backup and
archiving host. The tile comes pre-configured with nightly physical backups of
the database server for non-standalone plans:

| Day       | Backup Type | Time     |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Sunday    | Full        | 1 am UTC |
| Monday    | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Tuesday   | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Wednesday | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Thursday  | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Friday    | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Saturday  | Incremental | 1 am UTC |

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong>
Archiving and backups are disabled by default in the <code>standalone</code>
plan. Pivotal Platform users can set the <code>standalone_backups</code> parameter to
<code>true</code> to enable this feature.
</p>

Although backups only happen once a day, PostgreSQL is continuously shipping
the Write-Ahead-Logs (WAL) to the pgBackrest server. This means that
point-in-time recovery is possible, regardless of the schedule.

These backups not only offer peace of mind, but are used frequently by the tile.

Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform uses backups to create replicas in the stack.
By using backups in operations, we ensure that backup and restore operations are functioning properly.

All archives from the database server are stored on the dedicated backup host.
This means that databases can be restored to specific points in time.

Currently, individual databases cannot be restored. All databases are restored in the shared cluster.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note: </strong>
Standalone plans do not include automatic backups by default. When using a
standalone plan, you should regularly perform manual backups using external
tools, or enable the backup using the service creation/update parameter.
