title: Crunchy PostgreSQL For PCF
owner: Crunchy Data
---

Using the cloud-native platform Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), Crunchy Data
engineers have created a service offering that provides a secure, reliable,
and robust database infrastructure delivered as "Database-as-a-Service"
(DBaaS). Crunchy Certified PostgreSQL for PCF provides a Marketplace service
and complete PostgreSQL infrastructure to enable any applications deployed to
PCF to utilize PostgreSQL databases in a self-service, on-demand manner. This
allows developers to focus on coding and not the underlying infrastructure.

This documentation describes the Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
(PCF) tile. Installing this tile creates a service that allows PCF developers
to use Crunchy PostgreSQL databases with their apps.
