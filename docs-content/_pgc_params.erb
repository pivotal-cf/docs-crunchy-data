#### PostgreSQL Internal Settings

The default configuration settings for PostgreSQL attempt to
apply the most tuned settings for each plan and service instance.

It should not be necessary to change any of the low-level settings
unless a service instance is being used in a very advanced configuration.

However, if further configuration is found to be necessary, please
refer to [Crunchy Data's Official Documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/) for the full list of
settings that can be overridden manually.

More information specific to the individual values can be found in the
[Official PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/runtime-config.html).

#### Example Usage for PostgreSQL Internal Settings

For example, if you wish to create a service with custom PostgreSQL setting for `timezone` and `log_timezone`:

```sh
cf create-service <%= service_name %> <%= service_plan %> <%= service_instance_name %> -c '
{
    "db_name": "testdb",
    "db_username": "testuser",
    "owner_name": "Test User",
    "owner_email": "test.user@fabrikam.com",
    "pgc_timezone": "America/New_York",
    "pgc_log_timezone": "America/New_York"
}'
```

It is also possible to edit the PostgreSQL Config settings within an existing service.

For example, the following `update-service` command would set `timezone` and `log_timezone` to UTC:

```sh
cf update-service <%= service_instance_name %> -c '
{
    "pgc_timezone": "UTC",
    "pgc_log_timezone": "UTC"
}'
```
