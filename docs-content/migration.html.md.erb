## <a id='about'></a> About Migration

PostgreSQL minor releases never change the internal storage format and are always compatible with earlier and later minor releases of the same major version number. For example, v9.5.2 is compatible with v9.5, v9.5.1, and v9.5.6. Upgrades between minor versions of PostgreSQL allow for in-place upgrades because of this compatibility.

However, for major releases of PostgreSQL, the internal data storage format is subject to change, thus complicating upgrades. The traditional method for moving data to a new major version is to dump and reload the database.

New major versions also typically introduce some user-visible incompatibilities, so application programming changes may be required. Cautious users test their client applications on the new version before switching over fully. Therefore, Crunchy Data recommends setting up concurrent installations of old and new versions.


## <a id='basic-migration'></a> Basic Migration Guidelines

To dump data from one major version of PostgreSQL and reload it in another, you must use `pg_dump`. File system level backup methods will not work. There are checks in place that prevent you from using a data directory with an incompatible version of PostgreSQL, so no great harm can be done by trying to start the wrong server version on a data directory.

You can see the least downtime by installing the newer release on a different instance, running both the old and new in parallel.

If there is network-peering and communication between the two, Crunchy Data recommends you use the `pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall` programs from the newer version of PostgreSQL to take advantage of enhancements that might have been made in these programs.

Alternately, you can dump to an intermediate file from the old service, and restore on the new service. You should ensure that the old database is not updated after you begin to run `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall`, or you will lose those updates.

### <a id='tools'></a> CF Apps-Based Tools

There are several CF apps developed that can assist with this type of migration, such as:

- cf-pgadmin4
- cf-pgloader
