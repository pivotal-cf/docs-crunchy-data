#### Optional Extensions

It is also possible to add a number of various PostgreSQL extensions during a `create-service` or `update-service` command.
Please refer to [Crunchy Data's Official Documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/) for the full list of supported PostgreSQL extensions.


#### Unsupported Extensions

The following extensions are no longer supported due to deprecation from
the BOSH Stemcells:

- hstore_plpython2u
- hstore_plpythonu
- ltree_plpython2u
- ltree_plpythonu
- plpython2u
- plpythonu
- pltcl
- pltclu

#### Example Usage for Optional Extensions

For example, if you wish to create a service with the `btree_gist` extension installed:

```sh
cf create-service <%= service_name %> <%= service_plan %> <%= service_instance_name %> -c '
{
    "db_name": "testdb",
    "db_username": "testuser",
    "owner_name": "Test User",
    "owner_email": "test.user@fabrikam.com",
    "ext_btree_gist": true
}'
```

It is also possible to add or remove extensions from an existing service.

For example, the following `update-service` command would install `postgis`, and remove `btree_gist`:

```sh
cf update-service <%= service_instance_name %> -c '
{
    "ext_postgis": true,
    "ext_btree_gist": false
}'
```
