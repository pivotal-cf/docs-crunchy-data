By using port switching, apps have the ability to manage the types of database interactions their app needs.
When used correctly, this strategy allows apps to be more performant.

To query a `primary` cluster, apps must use the `5432` port on the load balancer.
This ensures that writes or reads are redirected to the primary cluster.

To query a `replica`, apps must use the `5433` port on the load balancer.
This ensures that reads are redirected to the replica cluster.
It is not possible to select an individual replica, so all connections will be
shared across all replicas in a 'round-robin' format.
For this reason, when explicitly accessing replicas, it is important to ensure the
total number of connections to these replicas do not exceed the `max_connections`
parameter.
