The following table provides information about the out-of-the-box cluster configurations:

| Plan               | Description                                                                                |
| --------           | -------------                                                                              |
| standalone         | Single PostgreSQL instance for development                                                 |
| standalone-replica | Single PostgreSQL instance configured to act as remote replica for an existing parent plan |
| general            | General purpose PostgreSQL cluster, with load balancing and automated backups              |
| general-monitor    | Same as `general` but with support for Grafana                                             |
| custom             | Similar to `general`, but with user-customizable disk/cpu/instance settings                |
| custom-monitor     | Same as `custom` but with support for Grafana                                              |

The current limitations for these cluster configurations are as follows:

- The number of replicas are only configurable during initial setup.
- All replicas use `async` replication. `sync` replication is not yet configurable.
- Standalone instances should be used with care, as they lack any of the integrated backup or recovery systems provided in the General plans.
