#### Creating a Service Key

To create a service key for an external application, run `cf create-service-key
SERVICE_NAME SERVICE_KEY_NAME`, substituting `SERVICE_NAME` with the name of
your service and `SERVICE_KEY_NAME` with a name for the service key, e.g.
`SERVICE_NAME_sk`. The service credentials JSON object can be viewed by
running `cf service-key SERVICE_NAME SERVICE_KEY_NAME`. For example:

```sh
cf create-service-key myService myService_sk
cf service-key myService myService_sk
```

Service Keys presently accept one optional parameter:

- "remote_replica": true

The `create-service-key` command expects these parameters as
JSON:

```sh
cf create-service-key myService myService_sk -c '{"remote_replica": true}'
```

#### Deleting a Service Key

To delete a service key, run `cf delete-service-key SERVICE_NAME
SERVICE_KEY_NAME`, substituting `SERVICE_NAME` with the name of
your service and `SERVICE_KEY_NAME` with the name of the service key. For
example:

```sh
cf delete-service-key myService myService_sk
```
